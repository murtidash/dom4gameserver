node piece that resides on server that has backend only providing restful services

creategame - handled by post to /games

07:22 <brainwrinkle> brainstorming the least possible effort here:
07:22 <murtidash> but i guess that's technically the same thing, but with the "password" being dynamically generated by ggs
07:23 <brainwrinkle> URL on the GGS game page to your angular page where the server host has a password
07:23 <brainwrinkle> to manage all the automation stuff
07:23 <murtidash> GGS can show or not show that link based on if you are game owner
07:24 <murtidash> and if the server you're using has automation enabled (check box on ggs)
07:24 <brainwrinkle> yep
